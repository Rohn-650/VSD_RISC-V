# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program

**Participant:** Rohn  
**Platform:** Synopsys EDA & SCL 180nm PDK  

This repository documents my progress through the 20-week **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**, a national initiative focused on hands-on, end-to-end chip designâ€”from RTL to silicon.

## Structure
- `Week_0/` - Environment Setup
- `Week_1/` - Functional Validation
- `Week_2/` - IP Integration *(Structure continues for each week)*

## Overview
The program covers the complete VLSI flow using industry-standard tools, culminating in a tapeout for fabrication. This project is part of India's mission to build skilled silicon designers.
