**Participant:** Rohn Eldho
**Platform:** Synopsys EDA & SCL 180nm PDK  

This repository documents my progress through the 20-week **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**, a national initiative focused on hands-on, end-to-end chip designâ€”from RTL to silicon.

## Structure
- `Week0/` - Environment Setup
- `week1/` - RTL Design & Synthesis Fundamentals: From Verilog to GLS
- `week2/` - SoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling: BabySoC Simulation & Analysis
- `week3/` - Physical Design Prep: Gate-Level Simulation & Static Timing Analysis
- `week4/` - CMOS Circuit Design: Device Physics, Characterization & Variation Analysis
- `week5/` - OpenROAD Flow Setup: Floorplan & Placement

## Overview
The program covers the complete VLSI flow using industry-standard tools, culminating in a tapeout for fabrication. This project is part of India's mission to build skilled silicon designers.
